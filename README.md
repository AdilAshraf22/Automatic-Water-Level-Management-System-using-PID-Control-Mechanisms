# 📌 Automatic Water Level Management System

# 📖 Overview

This system automates water level control using an Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensor, relay module, and water pump. It ensures that the tank maintains an optimal water level without overflowing or drying up.

# 🚀 Features

• Uses an ultrasonic sensor to monitor water levels in real-time.

• Controls a relay module to turn the water pump on/off automatically.

• Implements a PID algorithm for smooth and efficient operation.

• Minimizes water wastage by optimizing pump usage.

# 🛠 Hardware Components

• Arduino Uno (Microcontroller)

• Ultrasonic Sensor (For water level measurement)

• Relay Module (Controls water pump activation)

• Water Pump (For filling/draining the tank)

• Power Supply & Wiring

# 🖥 Software Requirements

• Arduino IDE (For code compilation and upload)

• C++ (Arduino Programming Language)

• PID Library for Arduino

# 🏗 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/water-level-management.git
   cd water-level-management

2. Upload the code to an Arduino board using Arduino IDE:
   ```sh
   arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:avr:uno water_level.ino
   arduino-cli upload -p /dev/ttyUSB0 --fqbn arduino:avr:uno water_level.ino

3. Monitor real-time performance:
   ```sh
   arduino-cli monitor -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200
